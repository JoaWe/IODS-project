# My Hopes for the course:
I have never used R or GitHub before and thus am very unsure about it. I hope that aside from learning the "How to...", I will also learn about the values of open access to data and research in general, as well as, the downsides. In other words: I am hoping for a lively discussion.  

I apologize, if my continuous corrections and adjustments make the evaluation of my work more difficult than necessary.But I feel that I need to see the outcome.
